                        <p> Hello! I'm Ananya, a current junior at Columbia University. I'm interested 
                            in the intersection of mathematics and computer science - specifically, 
                            leveraging technology to analyze large datasets and generate insights.
                        </p>
            
                        <p>
                            Through personal projects, internships, and coursework at Columbia, I've 
                            gained experience in Python, Java, and C. Additionally, majoring in Applied Mathematics has allowed me to develop 
                            quantitative analysis and probablistic reasoning skills. I've taken courses
                            in:
